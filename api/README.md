# Spring Boot RESTful API

## Usage
You can start the API by executing the start.sh or the start.bat


## Prerequisites

- [Install a JDK](https://www.oracle.com/de/java/technologies/downloads/) in at least version 21.
- Make sure that `JAVA_HOME` is set correctly to the root directory of your JDK. You can check with this command: `echo %JAVA_HOME%` (or `echo $JAVA_HOME` on Linux / Git Bash) (or `echo $Env:JAVA_HOME` in Powershell)
- Make sure that the JDK `bin` folder is added to your `PATH`. You can check with this command: `echo %PATH%` (or `echo $PATH` on Linux / Git Bash) (or `echo $Env:PATH` in Powershell)
- You can also install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) yourself, but if you use the Maven Wrapper scripts (`mvnw` or `mvnw.cmd`), this is not necessary, since Maven will be downloaded in this case
- Install and start a local [MariaDB server](https://mariadb.org/download/). You can instead use the [docker-compose.yml](../docker-compose.yml). If necessary, update the [API configuration file](src/main/resources/application.properties) with your database port (default is `3306`) and credentials (default is `root`:`root`)
